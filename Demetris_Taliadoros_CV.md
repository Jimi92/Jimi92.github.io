## Research experience
Ph.D. research, Environmental Genomics Group, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology (2020-2023)

•	Investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation and host specialization of plant pathogenic fungi

•	Inferring demographic histories of different fungal plant pathogen populations using simulation-based (e.g., ABC) and Sequential Markov coalescence algorithms

•	Identifying genomic regions evolving under strong directional selection through genomic scans for selective sweep signatures within and between populations 

•	Identifying genomic features relevant for local adaptation, located in selective sweep regions

## Relevant skills
•	Strong foundation in population genetics
•	Proficient in next-generation sequence analysis
•	Experienced in awk, R, and python

## Teaching experience
2021-2022: Population Genomics (biol-244), Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany
Responsibilities:

•	Guide students through practical exercises using state-of-art population genomic software and packages on the terminal and in R

•	Lecture on genetic effects of population structure: A summary of concepts and tools.
2021-2023: Supervision of internships, BSc, and MSc projects 

•	Rune Sommerkamp (2022, Inter): Presence/absence variation as an indicator of the demographic history and selection in different plant pathogens

•	Rebekah Jolicoeur (2021, Intern): Host-driven divergence of Cercospora beticola populations in the UK. The case of crop-specialized lineages
