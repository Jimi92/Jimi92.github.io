### *Postdoctoral researcher*

I am an evolutionary biologist, currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Webster lab](https://www.websterlab.net), based at the Uppsala University.

My research interests encompass the study of local adaptation, host specialization, and the inference of demographic history of bees and fungi. Through my stusies I aim to gain insights into adaptation under strong directional selection related to the current climate change earth is called to takle in the comming years.

## &#128478; News

&#128226; Start working as a postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University. during my time at Matt Webster's [lab] (https://www.websterlab.net), I will assess the impact of climate change on wild and domesticated bees

&#127891; Recently, I successfully defended my Phd thesis, titled "Population and evolytionary genetics of two economically important fungal plant pathogens". It is publicly available [here](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3573746_1/component/file_3573747/content)

&#128214; New publication in PLoS Genetics: [Emergence and spread of the barley net blotch pathogen coincided with crop domestication and cultivation history](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010884)

&#128209; New preprint [Deep population structure linked to host vernalization requirement in the barley net blotch fungal pathogen](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.20.572564v1) 

&#128209; New preprint on the origin and evolution of wild and domesticated beets. Great collaboration with my good friend and senior scientist at KWS, Amar Dhiman
