I am an Evolutionary biologist, currently employed as a postdoc at the [Webster lab](https://www.websterlab.net)

My research interests encompass the utilization of game theoretic modeling, numerical simulations, and data analysis to gain insights into behavior within social dilemmas and various scientific fields.

In addition to my research, I actively contribute to open-source projects. I am a fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute and serve as a topic editor for the Journal of Open Source Software.
